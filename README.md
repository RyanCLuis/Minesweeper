#MINESWEEPER#

This game will be close to you typical minesweeper, where you mark the boxes if you think there is an ant and select boxes to see if there are ants near by or "flood" boxes around for your next hint.

As a User, i want to...
- open the web browser to a game
- select a square to eleminate that choice and have three options: 1. keep playing 2. have the boxes remove and give me my next hint 3.hit an ant and startover
- see how many ants i will be dealing with
- have a option to "flag a square" so i dont click on it
- see a square i clicked on and see if there is an ant next to it
- have the ablity to play again
